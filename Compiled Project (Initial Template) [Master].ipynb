To better manipulate and analyse the `co2_emissions_from_agri.csv` file, it was loaded into a `Pandas` Data Frame using the `Pandas` function read_csv() and referred to as a data import. If `sep=None`, the import engine cannot automatically detect the separator, but the Python parsing engine can, meaning the latter will be used and automatically detect the separator from only the first valid row of the file by Python’s builtin sniffer tool, `csv.Sniffer` (hence the reason for importing the csv packages earlier as well). We will create a new variable called `co2_emissions_df` that will be a data import of our dataset which we can store in the memory for any future usage."

    "- We can see the dataset features have a total of 31 columns identified.\n",
    "- We can see the datatypes (`dtypes`) contains 29 `float64`; 1 `int64`; and 1 `object` datatype.\n",
    "- The dataframe object uses around 1.6 MB of memory. This is a very small amount considering the size of the dataset in question and actually suggests - given its low memory usage - any functions called from, applied to the dataset and used for analysis purposes should operate quite efficient without any noticeable slow processing speed.\n",

    "- The only features that are `float64` and might require some further investigation is `rural_population`, `urban_population`, `total_population_male` and `total_population_female` which do not necessarily makes sense to be a float datatype. Float is generally reserved for numerical values that contains decimals and chances are very slim that these features will contain decimals since a person (making part of the population) can never be a decimal person - there is no such thing as a decimal person. This can be further investigated in subsequent sections of this Chapter.\n",

    "Upon further investigation into the `area` feature of the dataset it was found that some `areas` have very non-user-friendly namings applied to them. Using these non-user-friendly `area` names will be fairly challenging moving forward in any future analysis and manipulation of the data. Leaving these names as-is will require far more clear specification when referencing those `areas` than necessary. An example would be `United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland` which is very cumbersome and long-winded to type out every time when referencing that specific `area`. Therefore, it would make more sense to convert such cumbersome `areas` to a name that is easier to reference moving forward while still maintaining a clear description of the `area`. For instance, `United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland` can be renamed to `United Kingdom` while still maintaining the same symantic meaning as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will proceed to perform this task by, first of all, identifying all the unique names in the `area` feature so as to start our analysis by focusing on those `areas` that have some cumbersome names. We will then simplify those names to make them easier to reference and reduce the naming complexity while still retaining its symantic meaning. To do this, we will use the `df[column_name].unique()` method. We will assign the result to a `list` object using the `list` type-casting method inherent in python. Finally, the resulting list will be displayed so as to interpret the results and find those `areas` requiring simplification in their name."

    "The next step in clearning our data is to identify outliers and determine an appropriate strategy for treating or dealing with the outliers in each column. We will endeavour to identify any outliers in each of the numerical columns in the dataframe by, first of all, determining the z-score for each numerical column in the dataframe. We will then count the number of observations under each column where the z-score values surpass the threshold level specified to determine their statistical signifigance. We would then be in a position to analyze all the outlier observations in each column so as to determine an appropriate strategy for dealing with outliers in those identified columns.\n",

    "Z-score is a measure that describeds how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean of the data set. It is a useful tool to standardize scores on a easily interpretable scale that allows for comparison across a multitude of distributions or data points. Z-scores are commontly used to identify outliers in any data set when those data points exceed a certain threshold. It also helps with ensuring a dataset can conform to uniform scales and helps to align dataset more towards the desired normal distribution when performing predictive analyses.\n",

For every column that is a numeric datatype, we will then calculate the Z-score using the `stats.zscore()` function and pass in the current column we iterating over in the `For` loop, also storing the result in a new feature called `Z-Score`. After that point, we will create a filtered dataframe object that will be filtered using the threshold of `Z-score` being greater than (`>`) 3 or being less than (`<`) -3, using the `Z-score` calculated previously. Inside the `outliers_summary` dictionary, we will then add the total observations outside of the specified `Z-score` threshold as a `value` reference. Once the loop through the columns have been completed, we will then perform another `For` loop through the `outliers_summary` dictionary and print out each feature of the dataset along with its outlier count."

The main tasks includes investigating and summarizing the dataframe's main characteristics by data visualization methods and statistical analyses. Furthermore, investigating the dataset’s key features, summarizing its central characteristics, and employing both data visualisation techniques and statistical analyses to draw meaningful insights that can guide further research and data-driven decision making."
